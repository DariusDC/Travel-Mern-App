# Travel App

This is one of the web apps I've build for my portfolio.
The idea of this is project is that the client can add some memories about some vacation and he cand insert the following things:
- Title
- Description
- Image
- Rating
After adding some of this data, he will place a **PopUp** on the map the exact location.

In order to start up the project, run the following commands: 

- In the root folder 
`npm run start`

- In the client folder (get there with `cd client`): 
`npm run start`
